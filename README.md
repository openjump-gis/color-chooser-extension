# color-chooser-extension

Color Chooser plugin for OpenJUMP allows to change color of features in a CAD style way.
This means that users have not to set attributes for features and define a style according to them.
This version of Color Chooser Plugin derives from SkyJUMP 
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/skyjump/) and was internationalized.
